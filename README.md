# HappyValentinsDay
   A funny code that asks your lover whether she/he loves you and makes sure that she/he have to choose YES. 
   The code will create a frame that let your lover choose whether she/he loves you. If she/he choose 'YES', everythingis normal, but if she/he tries to choose 'NO', something interestingwould happen. First, the 'NO' button would change its position, it lookes like it attemps to escape from being clicked. After a couple of rounds, if she/he still want to click 'NO' button, the 'NO' button and 'YES' button will exchange their position. Besides, the window will cannot be closed untill the 'YES' button is clicked. 
   To use this code, please make sure her/his computer has installed the JRE. 
   Note that this code is just a little joke, DO NOT USE IT AS A REAL VALENTIN'S DAY GIFT, if you want to get laid at Valentin's Day, use ROSE, WINE and FANCY RESTAURANT, if you want to keep your mate's love, use YOUR HEART.
